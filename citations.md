- Read through the documentation on [Polylith](https://polylith.gitbook.io/polylith) in general and the [clj-poly](https://github.com/polyfy/polylith) tool.  I also took a look at the [example systems](https://cljdoc.org/d/polylith/clj-poly/0.2.19/doc/example-systems) linked to by the `clj-poly` tool to confirm my understanding of the concepts.
- Looked up documentation for library: [clojure.json](https://github.com/clojure/data.json)
