- Status: accepted
- Date: 2024-04-28

Technical Story: [description | ticket/issue URL] <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

- [driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, …]
- [driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, …]
- … <!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

- Do nothing
- Keep a log in a single README in the repository
- Use [Architecture Decision Records](https://adr.github.io)

## Decision Outcome

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). Using the [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format and [madr-tools](https://github.com/nioe/madr-tools) for easier maintenance.

The use of the tool and simple markdown files in the repository keeps these decisions easily readable and accessible in the project.
